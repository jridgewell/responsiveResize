ResponsiveResize (AKA. Resizer)
===============================

First off, this is an unofficial fork of
[ResponsiveResize][].

The ResponsiveResize Safari Extension lets you resize the browser window
with pixel precision as an aid to building responsive websites. This
extension will detect all of the site's media queries, and create a
button that will resize the window to that size. If no queries are
found, a predefined list will be used.


Install
=======

Either download the [compiled
extension](compiled)
and drag it into Safari, or clone the repo and add it as an extension
from `Develop -> Show Extension Builder -> + (on the bottom left) -> Add
Extension` and locate the downloaded repo.
